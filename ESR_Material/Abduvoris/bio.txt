I am a from Uzbekistan, a beautiful country in the heart of the old Silk Road. I completed MSc from Erasmus Digital Communication Leadership (DCLead) program with the major in Digital Technology Management.
My research interest lies in time series management systems (TSMS) including their compression algorithms, storage structures and benchmarking. As a part of my doctorate, I collaborate with Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (SGRE) that provides me with valuable industry insights and opportunity to actually test our work in their use cases. As a final product of my doctorate, I aim to work on systems that implement model-based compression of time series and in particular, an open-source Time Series Management System, ModelarDB that uses model-based representation of time series for better compression and query response time, so the system is better matched the industry use-cases. This will hopefully lead to decreasing the cost of storing and analyzing sensor data which is one of the main challenges for IoT systems
