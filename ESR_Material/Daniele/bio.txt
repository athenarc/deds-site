I earned a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. I am currently pursuing a joint Ph.D. at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and the Athena Research Center (ARC) under the auspices of DEDS (No 955895), a Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network.
I embarked on his Ph.D. journey in 2021 and actively contributes as a member of the Machine Learning Group lab at ULB.
My research focuses on adversarial machine learning, fraud detection, and imbalanced learning
