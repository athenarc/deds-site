At the moment I have only one published work.
My only publication is “Adversarial Learning in Real-World Fraud Detection: Challenges and Perspectives”, published with the DEC '23: Proceedings of the Second ACM Data Economy Workshop. Here is the link: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600046.3600051 . You can find it in green open access here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01390 .

Concerning the social media posts, I was invited to post the article on Kudos (https://www.growkudos.com/?utm_source=navbar-logo), and here is the post: https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.1145%25252F3600046.3600051/reader . I do not know whether I shall mention DEDS also there, or if it counts as a social post.

A brief explanation of the paper, which I wrote for Kudos, can be found in the txt file. I hope it is clear and technical enough.

 

Concerning Github, here is the repository of a journal article we submitted and which is currently under review https://github.com/FaramirHurin/ADV-O

 

 

The bio is:

“Daniele Lunghi earned a master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Politecnico di Milano. He is currently pursuing a joint Ph.D. at the Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and the Athena Research Center (ARC) under the auspices of DEDS (No 955895), a Horizon 2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network.

He embarked on his Ph.D. journey in 2021 and actively contributes as a member of the Machine Learning Group lab at ULB.

His research focuses on adversarial machine learning, fraud detection, and imbalanced learning.”

 


I still need to collect the posters from previous presentations, but I will do it as soon as possible.

Please let me know if I am missing something else.
