My primary focus in this project is to integrate structured and unstructured data (e.g., text) in order to manage, combine and make decision over haterogenious data sources. My previous background is in Computational Linguistics and Machine Lerning, which enabled me to think out of the box in terms of Data Management and Integration from a non-database people. Currently I am trying to mitigate the data sparsity problem (missing values and incompleteness) during structured data integration using external textual sources via Information Extraction and Natural Language Processing. My main focus is to do this by using only the available structured data and without making the approach complex and resource hungry unlike recent advancement in machine learning. This is a difficult problem given that most  state-of-the-art techniques relies on massive annotated datasets. Apart from this, I am also involved in creating and benchmarking several datasets related to low-resource language development, handwriting recognition, opinion mining and health related data for integration scenarios."
