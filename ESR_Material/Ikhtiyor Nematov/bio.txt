Ikhtiyor obtained his bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Tashkent University of Information Technologies, Uzbekistan, in 2017. He then pursued a Joint Master's degree in the SMARTNET 2020 program, funded by the Erasmus Mundus scholarship. The program involved the first year at the University of Athens, Greece, and the second year at Télécom SudParis, France. During his Master's, Ikhtiyor conducted his internship at Nokia Bell Labs France, focusing on "Machine Learning for Interoperability of IoT". Currently, he is pursuing a Ph.D. in the DEDS (Data Science Data Engineering) program, operating under the Horizon 2020 – Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2020) framework. His research spans two universities, spending two years at Université Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium and one year at Aalborg University in Denmark.	

Ikhtiyor Nematov's PhD in the DEDS program is focused on Explainable AI (XAI), an emerging subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). As the application of machine learning models for decision-making tasks, especially in high-stakes domains, continues to grow, there is a pressing need for techniques that can elucidate opaque and complex models. In many scenarios, explaining the predictions of black-box models by identifying the most influential training data samples is crucial. However, existing approaches often lack customization for user intent, providing a uniform set of explanation samples that fail to reveal the model's reasoning from various perspectives. This PhD study not only addresses shortcomings in current methods but also proposes practical solutions to rectify these issues. Furthermore, it introduces innovative directions in the XAI field by developing new methods.
