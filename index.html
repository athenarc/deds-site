          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">What is DEDS</h1>
          <p>Data is a key asset in modern society. Data Science, which focuses on deriving valuable insight and knowledge from raw data, is indispensable for any economic, governmental, and scientific activity. Data Engineering provides the data ecosystem (i.e., data management pipelines, tools and services) that makes Data Science possible. The European Joint Doctorate in "Data Engineering for Data Science" (DEDS) is designed to develop education, research, and innovation at the intersection of Data Science and Data Engineering. Its core objective is to provide holistic support for the end-to-end management of the full lifecycle of data, from capture to exploitation by data scientists.</p>

          <p>DEDS 
          <img id="logoBoxInline" src="images/logocmpl.png" style="" />            
          operates under the Horizon 2020 - Marie Skłodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks (H2020-MSCA-ITN-2020) framework. It is jointly organised by Université Libre de Bruxelles (Belgium), Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (Spain), Aalborg Universitet (Denmark), and the Athena Research and Innovation Centre (Greece). Partner organisations from research, industry and the public sector prominently contribute to the programme by training students and providing secondments in a wide range of domains including Energy, Finance, Health, Transport, and Customer Relationship and Support.</p>

          <p> DEDS is a 3-year doctoral programme based on a co-tutelle model. A complementary set of 15 joint, fully funded, doctoral projects focus on the main aspects of holistic management of the full data lifecycle. Each doctoral project is co-supervised by two beneficiaries and includes a secondment in a partner organisation, which grounds the research in practice and validate the proposed solutions. DEDS delivers innovative training comprising technical and transversal courses, four jointly organized summer and winter schools, as well as dissemination activities including open science events and a final conference. Upon graduation, a joint degree from the universities of the co-tutelle will be awarded.</p>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Why DEDS</h1>
      
          <p>Data drives the world. Market analysts <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/the-age-of-analytics-competing-in-a-data-driven-world">state</a>: "Data is now a critical corporate asset. It comes from the web, billions of phones, sensors, payment systems, cameras, and a huge array of other sources, and its value is tied to its ultimate use. While data itself will become increasingly commoditized, value is likely to accrue to the owners of scarce data, to players that aggregate data in unique ways, and especially to providers of valuable analytics".</p>

          <p>A typical data value creation chain encompasses multiple disciplines and people with different roles, of which Data Science and Data Engineering are two prominent examples. Data Science (DS) is the scientific interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured. Data scientists focus on extracting meaning and insight from data through analytics. They are supported in their activities by Data Engineering (DE). Data engineers design and build the data ecosystem that is essential to analytics. Data engineers are responsible for the databases, data pipelines, and data services that are prerequisites to data analysis and data science.</p> 

          <p>In setting up these pipelines and functionalities that comprise the ecosystem, data engineers are often faced with challenges posed by extreme characteristics of Big Data, defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "data of a very large size, typically to the extent that its manipulation and management present significant logistical challenges". Addressing these challenges demand innovative technological solutions for data management, involving new architectures, policies, practices and procedures that properly manage the full data lifecycle needs of an organisation.</p>

          <p>The Big Data Value Strategic Research & Innovation <a href="http://bdva.eu/sites/default/files/BDVA_SRIA_v4_Ed1.1.pdf">Agenda</a> expresses the commitment of the European Commission (EC), industry and academia partners "to build a data-driven economy across Europe, mastering the generation of value from Big Data and creating a significant competitive advantage for European industry, boosting economic growth and jobs." The agenda particularly emphasises "the existence of data assets of homogenous qualities (e.g. geospatial, time series, graphs and imagery), which calls for optimizing the performance of existing core technology (e.g. querying, indexing, feature extraction, predictive analytics and visualization)," as well as "there is a need to create complex and fine-grained predictive models on heterogeneous and massive datasets such as time series or graph data... such models must be applied in real-time on large amounts of streaming data."</p>

          <p>Recent years have witnessed the birth of novel data management tools designed to address several of the Big Data challenges, but the problems and opportunities in the data engineering and management domain to unleash the full potential of data are still greatly unexplored. What is missing is a holistic, end-to-end management of the full lifecycle of data, from their identification and capture till their exploitation by end-users, including data scientists.</p>

          <p> The Data Engineering for Data Science (DEDS) programme aims at carrying out foundational research within the Big Data <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21569-3_3">value chain</a> to develop new technologies that improve the data management efficiency, and specifically for Data Science. DEDS will be delivered by a consortium composed of four European beneficiaries with a world-leading position in Data Management, Data Engineering, and Data Science. The consortium will be complemented by a network of partner organisations from industry and the public sector active in a wide range of disciplines, including Energy, Health, Finance, Transport, and Customer Relationship and Support. The consortium shares a vision statement:</p>

          <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
          <p><b>The DEDS programme will be a worldwide reference in advancing research and education in data management innovation for solving the critical challenges facing the society now and in the future.</b></p>
          </div>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Mission</h1>

          <p>DEDS brings together world-leading institutions with a long experience in both research and teaching collaboration and define a concrete and realistic common mission statement (MS) as follows:</p>
      
          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><b>MS1</b>: Create and effectively disseminate cross-disciplinary essential knowledge about the generation, collection, exploitation, and value-creation of data for efficient decision-making.</li>
            <li><b>MS2</b>: Educate ethical professionals and future leaders in data-driven innovation.</li>
            <li><b>MS3</b>: Integrate, synthesise, and transfer scientific knowledge that enables smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth, by unleashing the potential of data-driven innovation in different disciplines for addressing societal problems, such as health care, effective energy use, and transport.</li>
            <li><b>MS4</b>: Establishing a European data management toolkit for Data Science by creating novel functionalities and feeding them back into well-established open source data processing engines (e.g., Spark and PostgreSQL) and Data Science platforms (e.g., SWAN and RapidMiner).</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Objectives</h1>

          <p>The programme is designed to provide understanding and competencies (i.e., the combination of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that students develop and apply for successful learning, living and working) in the strategic area of data management and engineering for Data Science. It will prepare the graduates for a research and innovation career both in academia and, equally important, in the ICT industry and public services. In this respect, we acknowledge the relevance of the European Research Agenda <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/era/eraprogress_en.htm">Report</a>, and commit ourselves to contribute specially to the objectives of removing barriers to the wider use of knowledge, promote wider and faster circulation of scientific ideas, as well as fully utilising gender diversity and equality. More precisely, the consortium has defined the following quantifiable objectives (O):</p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><b>O1</b>: To produce foundational cross-disciplinary research about the generation, collection, and exploitation of large-scale data for efficient decision-making, publish it in top scientific outlets, and promote the development of novel technologies and tools. Exploitation will be ensured by integrating them in existing open source and commercial Big Data tools to enable the extraction of valuable information in industry and public services.</li>
            <li><b>O2</b>: To educate and train talented doctoral candidates in large-scale data management and analytics, fostering the knowledge triangle between education, research, and innovation, including both technical and transferable competencies, like ethics awareness and entrepreneurial spirit.</li>
            <li><b>O3</b>: To establish an integrated pan-European Network of Excellence in large-scale data management that promotes the creation of tools and resources, continuously monitoring their quality and adequacy to the market needs and societal challenges, and attracting excellent local and foreign researchers. It will be composed of the beneficiaries and associated partners, as well as the software toolkit, equipment and datasets.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Added Value</h1>

          <p>The originality, added value and innovative aspects of the programme can be summarised as follows:</p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>The first integrated and transnational doctoral programme in the domain worldwide.</li>

      <!-- Programme -->
      <div id="frmProgramme" class="frmClass w3-row w3-padding-32">
        <div class="w3-row w3-twothird w3-container">

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Programme Overview</h1>

          <p>DEDS is a joint doctoral programme of three-year duration. In case of unforeseen difficulties, up to two additional six-month periods can be granted if (1) it is duly justified, and (2) the Candidate Progress Committee considers the completion of a Doctoral Thesis feasible within the extended period of time.</p>

          <p>Each ESR will be enrolled in the PhD programmes at both Home and Host universities and work on an individual research project with a supervisory team consisting of at least two academic supervisors (one from Home, one from Host), complemented by one secondment supervisor from a partner organisation.           Note that, for those ESRs (co-)supervised by beneficiary ARC, the doctoral degree will be awarded by academic partner UOA.</p>

          <p>The research activity will be carried out in the Home and Host Universities, during alternate successive mobility periods, and also includes at least one secondment in a partner organisation of the consortium. The time spent in the Host University will be no less than 33% of the total duration of the studies.</p>

          <p>Differences among ESRs in background knowledge, original skills, and interests are expected. Thus, instead of preparing a generic training programme, ESRs will have a personalised Doctoral Project Plan (DPP) created right at the beginning of their projects. The DPP builds upon their individual background and future career prospects, allowing ESRs to tailor their own research and training activities with respect to their project objectives and individual needs, and complementing core scientific competencies with innovation-related and transferable ones. The DPP will ensure the appropriate synergy and balance between research and training, following a strict timeline to complete the doctorate in three years. The DPP jointly designed by the ESR and his/her co-supervisors, must include:</p> 

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li> (1) Research-specific, innovation and entrepreneurship, as well as language courses</li>
            <li> (2) Participation in the summer and winter schools</li>
            <li> (3) At least three international peer-reviewed publications</li> 
          </ul>
          
          <p>The research-specific courses will be delivered by the doctoral schools at the beneficiaries, and the other courses by both the beneficiaries and the partner organisations. The DPP also describes the activities of the ESR's secondment, which aims at validating the ESR's specific research in practice and exposing the ESR to the professional world.</p>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Training Programme</h1>

          <p>DEDS is a joint doctoral programme in which all ESRs will follow a common process, regardless of the institutions involved. The programme fosters a wide range of technical and transferable competencies (i.e., combinations of knowledge, skills, and attitudes) aiming to improve the career prospects of ESRs and to prepare innovative leaders and entrepreneurs. The doctoral programme comprises the following activities:</p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><b>Research</b>: Doctoral candidates work on a novel research problem guided by two supervisors who will advise and train them to gradually become independent researchers.</li>
            <li><b>Doctoral courses</b>: Courses will be chosen by each ESR individually in coordination with his/her supervisors from the list of available courses in each university. At least 30 ECTS of courses must be chosen (distributed in a minimum of 20 ECTS in research-specific courses and a minimum of 10 ECTS in the others). The list comprises Research-specific courses, Innovation and entrepreneurship courses, Methodological and communication courses, and Language courses. </li>
            <li><b>Summer and winter schools</b>: Invited researchers and practitioners meet and challenge the ESRs. These schools, also open to the public, enable the ESRs to get international contacts in both industry and academic sectors as well as feedback on presentations of their research. The schools are network-wide events that involve both beneficiaries and partner organisations.</li>
            <li><b>Tutoring</b>: ESRs will be involved in teaching and educational activities, such as supervising undergraduated student projects and delivering exercises and laboratory sessions. The time spent by ESRs on teaching activities will be calibrated with national regulations, resulting in a workload equivalent to that of any doctoral in the same university.</li>
            <li><b>Knowledge dissemination</b>: Mandatory conference participation and publications allowing ESRs to present their findings, thereby familiarising themselves with essential academic practices such as peer-review and public debating.</li>
            <li><b>External cooperation</b>: ESRs will work with domain experts at partner organisations on intersectoral problems, get experience with interdisciplinary team work, and gain transferable skills such as familiarizing themselves with cutting-edge production systems, which will also strengthen their position to a highly competitive job market.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">The Road to Success</h1>

          <p>A jointly designed doctoral process described in the figure below will ensure a continuous monitoring of the ESRs.</p> 

          <img id="doctoral-process" class="topics" src="images/process.png" alt="DEDS doctoral process">

          <p>Each ESR will be involved in a Joint Doctoral Topic offered by two beneficiaries (i.e., Home and Host) with a secondment in a partner organisation. ESRs will be co-supervised by two experienced researchers using a co-tutelle model, and a third advisor with research experience from the corresponding secondment will provide ESRs an essential knowledge, experience and guidance for their future career. </p>

          <p>To ensure a uniform evaluation, a Candidate Progress Committee (CPC) will be assigned to each ESR. The CPC consists of (1) Supervisor from Home institution; (2) Co-supervisor from Host institution; (3) Committee chair, who is a supervisor from a beneficiary distinct from the Home and Host. A secondment supervisor from a partner organisation will be invited to the CPC to provide a non-academic perspective. The CPC chair is responsible for ensuring that the process, milestones, and intermediate evaluations are met; he/she will also act as referee in case of potential disputes.</p>

          <p>Each ESR will meet at least once every week the supervisor of the institution where he/she is located, and the other supervisor will join remotely every other week. These meetings allow ESRs to present their results, ask questions, etc. Also, periodic monitoring meetings are planned every 2.5 months between the ESR, all members of the Candidate Progress Committee (CPC), and the WP leader. These meetings should include some slides and produce minutes drafted by the ESR and reviewed by the local supervisor stating: (1) what was done since the last meeting, (2) what will be done for the next meeting, (3) what is slowing down or blocking the project, and (4) what was discovered that would be of interest, or needs to be discussed. 

          <p>During the secondments, the ESRs will be supervised by an experienced researcher at the secondment partner organisation. Regular meetings with the academic supervisors will still continue during this period to ensure the coordination of the overall project.</p>

          <p>During the joint training events, ESRs will have the opportunity to meet both supervisors face to face, allowing further synchronisation and discussion of the monitoring reports (see below) produced by the candidates. </p>

          <p>To monitor the ESRs' progress, four milestones are defined, each accompanied by the corresponding document, which will be jointly evaluated. </p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><b>Milestone 1</b>: Two months after the enrolment, the ESR together with his/her co-supervisors will deliver a <i>Doctoral Project Plan (DPP)</i>, which formulates the elements involved in the research process. In addition, the DPP will specify the ESR's personalised doctoral training programme taking into account his/her previous background and future career prospects.</li>

            <li><b>Milestone 2</b>: In the <i>Thesis Proposal Report (TPR)</i>, the DPP is updated by the ESR according to the experiences gained during the first stage of the doctorate. The TPR is much more concrete and elaborated than the DPP and should be delivered no later than one month before the end of the first year.</li>

            <li><b>Milestone 3</b>: In the <i>Research Progress Report (RPR)</i>, the ESR updates the TPR according to the experiences gained during the second stage of the doctorate. The RPR includes a description of the main issues, early research results, and plan for the remaining work. The RPR should be delivered no later than one month before the end of the second year. </li>

            <li><b>Milestone 4</b>: The <i>Doctoral Thesis</i> will be submitted at the end of the third year (M4).</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The DPP, TPR, and RPR will all be accompanied by a <i>Career Development Plan (CDP)</i> that discusses the ESR's envisioned career opportunities and a roadmap to achieve them. After the submission of the Doctoral Thesis, the CDP is updated again to reflect achieved and new goals.</p>

          <p>At the end of a secondment, a <i>Secondment Report (SR)</i> is prepared, describing not only the work and achieved goals, but also reflections on the experiences made and their influences on the ESR's future.</p>

          <p>The DPP will be presented in a poster session in the first winter school, the TPR and RPR will be defended in front of the CPC and an external evaluator during the summer schools. A common evaluation of these documents was designed and includes the assessment of the potential contribution to innovation. If a report is not satisfactory, the ESR must resubmit within one month a new version that takes the CPC's feedback into account. If this version is not satisfactory, a "get back on track" procedure is activated, whereby the supervisors prepare a detailed action plan for the ESR's performance to become satisfactory after a three-month period. Subsequently, the CPC decides if the progress has been re-established. If the ESR does not accept this procedure or is unable to recover lost ground, he/she will be withdrawn from the programme. This decision does not necessarily entail any consequence with respect to the participation of the Candidate in local Doctorate programmes of the Home and Host universities.</p>

          <p>The Doctoral Thesis will be evaluated with a common form in addition to local forms used by the Home and Host universities. It should contain material for at least 3 international peer-reviewed publications in indexed conferences or journals, of which 2 should be accepted for publication at the time of submission. After a unanimous recommendation by the CPC, it is submitted for evaluation by a Thesis Assessment Board (TAB) composed of members from at least four different institutions, containing: (1) at least one member from each of the Home and Host HEIs, and (2) at least one member external to the consortium, (3) the chair of the CPC (if local rules at the beneficiaries prevent this, e.g., due to a recent co-authorship between the supervisor and a potential TAB member, the local rules will be respected). The TAB will first state whether the thesis is satisfactory or not. If it is, a public, oral defence of the thesis will be held at the Home university in front of the TAB. Furthermore, the ESR will also present her/his work at a public seminar at the Host university. If the TAB considers the thesis is not satisfactory (which will occur rarely based on the partners' experience), it shall state whether the thesis may be resubmitted in a revised version within a deadline of at least three months. As stated in the Doctoral Candidate Agreement, ESRs who did not reach minimum criteria in the new version of the thesis will not be awarded the joint doctorate degree.</p>

          <p>All other activities of the doctoral programme will also be assessed using a commonly agreed evaluation procedure. Secondments will be assessed using a common evaluation designed by the consortium. The ECTS acquired by an ESR in the programme will be recognised by the two institutions of the co-tutelle, independently of where they were acquired. Furthermore, the ESR's monitoring will be based on deliverables collected in a Candidate's Portfolio (CP) that contains, at least: (1) Doctoral Candidate Agreement, (2) DPP, (3) Transcripts of the courses, (4) Minutes of the periodic monitoring meetings, (5) TPR, (6) RPR, (7) Conference participations and other publications, (8) Secondment Reports. The CP will be at the disposal of the ESR, the CPC, and TAB.</p>

          <p>In summary, the quality of the joint supervision results from:</p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li> The joint doctoral process, which will maximise the ESRs' potential by a continuous monitoring.</li>
            <li> The expertise of the supervisors, who will ensure the pertinence of the research work with respect to the state-of-the-art.</li>
            <li> The beneficiaries, which are all highly recognised institutions and have worked together in European research and educational projects.</li>
            <li> The network of distinguished partner organisations.</li>
            <li> The quality assessment mechanisms for the programme.</li> 
            <li>The demanding DEDS graduation requirements, which go beyond the standard criteria.</li>
            <li> The competitive selection procedure will lead to high quality research contributions.</li>

          <p>DEDS groups the planned contributions needed to unlock value from raw data into the following four functional modules, each addressing a different subset of research challenges:</p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li>The <b>Governance</b> module considers privacy-aware mechanisms to manage and trace all data during the Data Science lifecycle, facilitating its automation.</li>
            <li>The <b>Storage and Processing</b> module investigates scalable mechanisms to efficiently store and process different kinds of data (e.g., temporal, geographical) both at rest (e.g., operational, historical) as well as in motion (e.g., real-time) benefiting from specific hardware accelerators.</li>
            <li>The <b>Preparation</b> module implements tools to effectively preprocess the data for analysis.</li>
            <li>The <b>Analysis</b> module extends traditional querying by devising data management mechanisms specifically tailored to analytical tasks.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The four modules collectively cover essential data engineering functionalities required along the Data Science lifecycle. Each module forms a work package (WP) and is composed of multiple Early Stage Researcher (ESR)) projects as shown in the following figure.</p>

              <div id="esr_1_1" class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: The variety of data models and technologies among different systems requires that metadata are flexibly represented and governed. While current approaches introduce vocabularies to represent basic metadata artifacts (e.g., data schema, user queries), most of the processing still relies on the user explicitly querying the original artifacts and not the vocabulary. This project will use semantic graphs to develop models, techniques, and methods that automatically select and combine basic metadata artifacts into more complex ones, supporting advanced user assistance data governance tasks such as integration of new instances, traceability or privacy-aware processing, considering semantics.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A framework to store basic metadata and support the modeling of analysis-ready complex artifacts. (2) A method to automatically manage mappings of different kinds of sources and govern the processing both at the schema and data level. (3) A prototype showing the feasibility of this approach. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

                <p><b>Objectives</b>: It is common for analysts to work in collaborative environments relying on partial results produced by others, having only a limited view of the whole data flow. Thus, it is needed to systematically keep track of all transformations of data from the source to the result of the analysis, and evaluate how the original characteristics of the data are affected, to guarantee traceability and improve trustability. In this project, we will cope with problems ranging from the amount of annotations produced (bigger than the data themselves), to the impact of data transformations in the quality metrics, going through the process distribution. We will first collect metadata at different granularities without overloading the processing engine, then link them properly, and estimate the effect of transformations.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A mathematical model that allows to propagate trust as well as quality metrics through the data transformations. (2) A distributed protocol to keep track of data transformations at different granularities. (3) A prototype showing the usability and impact of trust and quality annotations. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Basically all applications in Data Science need to combine/integrate data originating from multiple heterogeneous datasets (XML, Excel, RDF, etc.). This challenging task becomes even more challenging if we consider that some parts of the data might have to be protected to ensure privacy. This is particularly true for applications in health care, where some data requires protection while still allowing for efficient access and analysis (e.g., patient data or results of certain studies). This project will focus on the integration of private personal data from multiple sources, by carefully ensuring the level of exposition of every instance.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A framework for analysing heterogeneous datasets. (2) A method to protect privacy while enabling integrated access. (3) A prototype showing the feasibility of this approach. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Bringing computation closer to data is a must when dealing with large datasets in highly distributed systems with very specialised hardware components. Some relevant examples are supporting in-situ data transformations (e.g., decrypt on read) and tier crossings (e.g., select the form of compression based on physical medium to be moved to). The goal of this project is to improve the performance of the data processing engine, such as Spark, by leveraging hardware specificities, without affecting the interface to applications. The approach consists in improving scalability by decoupling the engine primitives from the underlying data store platform, in such a way that tasks can be delegated to avoid data transfers through the different levels of the stack, and benefit from specific hardware.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A framework to allow data operators to ship code to be executed in-place at the low-level store. (2) A method to communicate available in-place computation capabilities. (3) Connectors to the low-level store for a Big Data processing engine. (4) Evaluation of the connectors.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: The curse of dimensionality is more and more relevant as the number of features to be tackled keeps on increasing in many areas, such as bioinformatics, predictive maintenance and IoT. The solution is to perform a careful and efficient feature selection before analysing the dataset. Thus, the purpose of this project is to propose the appropriate data distribution and replication policies, taking into account their specific semantics rather than using a generic approach independent of the application, to optimise filter-based feature selection methods, such as mRMR, and their generalisation to other kinds of algorithms and their associated data structures.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A framework to distribute and replicate the data. (2) A method to decide the best distribution and allocation configuration. (3) A prototype showing the benefits in different analytical algorithms. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Industrial sensors, like those in wind turbines, generate large amounts of never ending time series, but only small parts of them (e.g., averages over 15 minute windows) can be handled and stored for analysis. Provided that many TBs or even PBs must be handled, it is vital to develop new methods for incremental storage and fast retrieval, that avoid accessing raw data to produce results. In this project, we focus on how to store such time series data by means of models and investigate how these models can be incrementally maintained and used to access both past data as well as predict future data.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A distributed framework for management of large amounts of sensor data supporting edge processing.

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Similarity joins, i.e., the matching of similar pairs of objects, is a fundamental operation in data management. In the spatial setting, the problem can be stated as follows: Given the sets P and Q of trajectories and a similarity threshold &theta;, return all pairs of trajectories with a similarity that exceeds &theta;. In the maritime domain, identifying similarities between trajectories of vessels is crucial for classifying vessel activities (e.g., fishing). In particular, (near) real-time similarity search is necessary to successfully identify events related to navigational safety (e.g., piracy). Real-time similarity search is a computationally challenging problem,  however. As such, the objective in this project is to develop techniques that allow efficient (near) real-time trajectory similarity search.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A set of similarity measurement operators. (2) Efficient index structures to support the proposed operators.

                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Contemporary analytical pipelines interconnect a myriad of scripts, programs and tools, often spanning a multitude of programming languages (e.g., R, Python) and associated libraries (e.g., Spark, Tensor flow). While this re-use of existing frameworks reduces development time, it leads to sub-optimal performance due to the lack of end-to-end optimisations such as merge of loops or removal of materialisation points. The objective of this project is to propose techniques that allow such optimisation for analytic pipelines expressed in multiple languages and spanning multiple existing libraries, by using a common intermediate representation in which known DBMS-style optimisations can be expressed.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Modern Data Science processing workloads typically involve computations of extreme-scale analytics that can be encoded in various forms (e.g., queries, workflows, programs) and executed on more than one platform. Parts of the processing could be pushed to the edge level (e.g., input sensors), while other more computationally intensive parts (e.g., stock correlation in finance, gene simulations in life sciences) could be executed on one or more, potentially distributed, Big Data platforms or clusters (e.g., GPUs) of a supercomputer or in the cloud. The decision on what is the right platform and timing to execute a Data Science workload is based on a multitude of criteria and optimization objectives, including hardware and processing capabilities, scheduled and running workloads, available resources and pricing, and so on. In this project, we develop tools and techniques for optimizing (e.g., in terms of runtime, throughput, latency, scheduling, system resources, monetary resources) the execution of Data Science workloads across different computing platforms.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) New optimisation and workload management techniques for large scale Data Science workloads. (2) Multi-platforms cost model analysis. (3) Prototype of all new methods developed. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Many companies collect very large quantities of spatio-temporal data, e.g., transport companies collect telemetric data that are currently used for scheduling, billing, and other administrative tasks. Efficiently managing, integrating, and analysing such spatio-temporal data together with other types of data is a very challenging task. Based on multiple, large datasets, the project annotates a digital map with novel information to be able to accurately quantify the driving, e.g., in terms of fuel consumption that is used for both analytic and predictive analysis. This project will therefore develop scalable processing techniques for integrating heterogeneous data with spatio-temporal datasets.</p>

                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Data preparation is among the most time-demanding parts of analytics. The aim of this project is to investigate techniques, including federated learning, to scale data preparation, enabling low-latency responses and automated proposals for data integration actions, without compromising data security and data privacy. In one embodiment, the data will be pre-processed for constructing compact synopses (i.e., summaries), which will enable the user to quickly navigate through different actions and interactively observe the effect on the data. The project will thus get the set of synopses that are best suited for the problem at hand (e.g., the best instance sample), build these synopses, use them to visualize the data and their relationships, and to propose actions.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) A framework for interactive data integration relying on synopses, including methods for automatic selection, construction, and tuning of the synopses, as well as recommendation generation for integration actions. (2) Methods to address critical issues such data privacy and data security. (3) Prototype of all new methods developed. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Information extraction, the activity of extracting structured information from unstructured text, is a core data preparation step. Systems for information extraction fall into two main categories: machine-learning-based (ML-based), and rule-based. In the former, models for extraction tasks are automatically obtained by ML methods, which however requires large amounts of training data. In the latter, extraction rules are manually written by human experts, which obviates training data and has the benefit of the rules being explainable, but is labor intensive. Despite advances in ML, rule-based systems are still widely used in practice. The objective in this project is to design and implement an information extraction system that combines the benefits of both categories.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) Design of a declarative language for mixed (rule and ML) information extraction. (2) Study of said language in terms of expressiveness and complexity. (3) Prototype implementation. (4) Evaluation of the prototype.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: The large scale and unstructured nature of complex Big Data makes interactive data exploration and analytics a non-trivial, expensive task for expert and non-expert data scientists. Traditional exploration and analysis methods often cannot cope with the generation pace and versatility of modern heterogeneous data sources. Supporting interactive data exploration and analytics, without sacrificing performance and overall user experience, requires rethinking and co-designing of the data management and analysis layers. In this project, we revisit the interface between data management and data exploration and analysis focusing on performance and expressivity. We identify new primitive operations for exploration and analytics, form workflows comprising primitive operations, and design effective solutions for optimizing such workflows. We develop techniques for enabling an advanced, user-friendly experience through enhanced exploration in natural language and by providing recommendations for spot on data analysis based on the characteristics of the data and the user requirements.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) New exploration and analysis techniques for complex Big Data, including exploration in natural language and recommendations for spot on analysis.

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Accurate machine learning requires the execution of a model selection phase to perform a number of design choices (e.g., learner), and to calibrate a number of parameters and hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers in a neural network). While model selection is conventionally performed offline and in main memory, the characteristics of contemporary Big Data scenarios require novel methodologies for performing accurate model selection in streaming and distributed settings. So far, the continuous incremental arrival of data has limited the range of considered model selection strategies to simple tuning and drift detection. The ambition in this thesis is to provide an extended library of resource-aware model selection techniques that manage the trade-off between reaction time and accuracy.</p>
                <p><b>Expected Results</b>: (1) Review and experimental comparison of existing online strategies for model assessment and selection. (2) Design and implementation of novel methods to model selection scale up. (3) Implementation of a prototype. (4) Evaluation of the prediction accuracy and scalability.</p>

              <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey topic-cnt">
                <p><b>Objectives</b>: Prescriptive analytics does not only predict the future but also suggests (prescribes) the best course of action to take. It entails information collection, extraction, consolidation, visualisation, forecast, optimisation, and what-if analysis. Thus, as a range of non-integrated and specialized tools have to be glued together in an ad-hoc fashion, building prescriptive analytics solutions is labor-intensive, error-prone, and inefficient. This project will build a generic platform for prescriptive analytics, which tightly integrates scalable data storage with declarative specification of queries, constraints, objectives, requirements, and mathematical optimisations in a unified framework.</p>

                Aalborg Universitet stands out among older and more traditional Danish universities with its orientation on interdisciplinary problem-based work. Since its establishment in 1974, AAU has built a worldwide reputation for its problem-based learning model of problembased project work – also known as The Aalborg Model – and by extensive collaboration with the surrounding society. Within the fields of technical and natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and health sciences, AAU currently educates more than 20,000 students, ranging from students at preparatory courses through doctoral-level candidates. These programmes aim to fulfil the requirements of both the private and the public sectors of the labour market. While AAU also provides elite programmes within a few selected areas (including data-intensive systems), it is taking steps to expand its reputation as an internationally recognised leading university within problem based learning. AAU’s programmes already attract approximately 15% international students, coming from different countries around the world. The international perspective is also reflected through the university’s active employment of international academic staff, the establishment of student exchange programmes and international research collaboration. AAU is characterised by combining a keen engagement in local, regional, and national issues with an active commitment to international collaboration. In 2015, AAU acquired 672 new external grants and administered external projects with a total turnover exceeding 85 million Euro. It has expanded its strong research areas ranging from basic research and applied research within all the academic fields represented at the university to world class research areas within selected fields. AAU has a strong focus on Information and Communications Technology (ICT), centred at the Technical Faculty of IT and Design. The strong focus makes AAU Denmark’s leading ICT university, attracting close to 39% of all new ICT students in Denmark. By further expanding its multidisciplinary research activities, increasing its collaboration across different research and knowledge areas, and strengthening its position as a network university, AAU has become one of the leading innovative universities in Europe. AAU has participated in 130 FP7 projects and currently participates in 57 H2020 projects.</p>

                The history of Computer Science at AAU goes back to 1976. In 1999 Computer Science became an independent department. The Department of Computer Science offers, apart from four programmes for Danishspeaking students, three international master’s programmes including one on Data Engineering. It also offers two elite education programmes within computer science: Data-Intensive Systems (headed by Prof. Pedersen) and Embedded Software Systems. The excellence of these programmes is recognised in the international benchmarking of Danish computer science in 2006: “AAU has developed programmes with a strong professional orientation [... that ...] make an important contribution to Danish computer science.” Currently, the department has 41 professors and 68 academic staff members, including more than 45 doctoral candidates, and educates around 1,000 students with 4% international. Along the line of the university, the department performs world-class international research within four main areas: database and programming technologies, distributed and embedded systems, machine intelligence, and information systems. The department has 7 ongoing or recent FP7 and H2020 projects.</p>

                The Database, Programming and Web Technologies unit (DPW) at AAU is one of the three research units of the Department of Computer Science. In 2006, the group expanded its activities by establishing the Center for Data- Intensive Systems (Daisy) as a powerful platform for research and industry collaboration. Currently, DPW/Daisy, co-headed by Prof. Pedersen, consists of 16 professors, four post-doc researchers and more that 20 doctoral candidates. The overall topics of the group include Web data, graph data, RDF, business intelligence, spatio-temporal data, data streams, scalable and distributed systems, data mining, location-based mobile services, and programming languages and tools. The group has strong collaborations with national and international industry partners and universities (including ULB and UPC in the IT4BI-DC Erasmus Mundus programme). In a research evaluation, covering the period 2006–2010, the independent international evaluation committee concluded that DPT/Daisy is “[...] among the top-5 database groups in Europe, on level with institutions like ETH, and with an analogous significant reputation at world level.” For the period 2011–2015, the international evaluation committee concluded that “the unit is of excellent quality. The unit performs at world-class level.”</p>

          <p>The partner organisations, nine of which have research departments, were selected to bring additional expertise to the consortium to support the beneficiaries in the training of students at the forefront of research and innovation. As domain experts and innovation leaders, they have unique insights into, and experience with, the specific problems of the data value creation lifecycle in their domain. Hence, they provide crucial use cases and datasets in which the proposed research can be grounded or validated. As the figure below illustrates, these use cases collectively cover a wide range of sectors and disciplines, including Energy (CERN, SG), Health (AUH, WHO), Finance (SPR, WOL), Transport (BSC, EUC, FDK, MT), and Customer Relationship and Support (DGT, EUN, ORA, RM). Besides their role of use case providers, as open source platform leaders, CERN and RM will also help on the integration of the research.</p>

          <p>Applications will be accepted until all positions are filled. We encourage excellent candidates to apply early to maximize chances that their first ESR choices will still be available.</p>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Eligibility Criteria</h1>

          <p>Applications must abide by the following minimum eligibility criteria (EC): </p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><b>EC1</b>: The Candidate must have been awarded the equivalent of 300 ECTS from his/her Bachelor and Master's degrees (of which, at least 60 of those ECTS must correspond to the Master's degree) with a major in computer science, from an accredited university listed in the World Higher Education Database (<a href="http://www.whed.net/home.php">WHED</a>) or included in the following university rankings: (a) <a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/">The Times Higher Education World University Rankings</a>, (b) <a href="http://www.arwu.org/">Academic Ranking of World Universities</a>, or (c) <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings">QS World University Rankings</a>.</li>

            <li><b>EC2</b>: The Candidate must be able to demonstrate proficiency in English by means of:
            <p>(a) Either an internationally recognised test equivalent to level C1 in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (<a href="http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/linguistic/CADRE_EN.asp">CEFR</a>). These tests include, e.g., Cambridge English First A, IELTS (academic) 7.0, TOEFL (paper based) 590, TOEFL (computer based) 243, TOEFL (Internet based), etc.</p>
            <p>(b) Or, a document issued by the university awarding his/her Bachelor or Master's degree certifying that its tuition language was English.</p>
            </li>

            <li><b>EC3</b>: The Candidate must be, at the date of recruitment, in the first four years (full-time equivalent research experience) of his/her research career and has not been awarded a doctoral degree. The full-time equivalent research experience is measured from the date when the Candidate obtained the degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctorate, either in the country in which the degree was obtained or in the country in which the Candidate is recruited, even if a doctorate was never started or envisaged. Applicants who were awarded the degree entitling him/her to embark on a doctorate in a period longer than the stated, must describe in the cover letter the activities undertaken during this period. These activities cannot be research-oriented.</li>

            <li><b>EC4</b>: The Candidate must not have resided or carried out his/her main activity (work, studies, etc.) in the country of the Home Institution for more than 12 months in the 3 years immediately before the recruitment date. Compulsory national service, short stays such as holidays, and time spent as part of a procedure for obtaining refugee status under the Geneva Convention are not taken into account.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Selection Procedure</h1>

          <p>Eligible applications will be scored according to the following selection criteria (SC):</p>

          <ul class="w3-ul">
            <li><b>SC1</b>: Domain of the bachelor and master 15% </li>
            <li><b>SC2</b>: Normalised academic results 40% </li>
            <li><b>SC3</b>: Research experience 15% </li>
            <li><b>SC4</b>: Professional experience 10% </li>
            <li><b>SC5</b>: Recommendation letters 10% </li>
            <li><b>SC6</b>: CV, research proposal, and motivation 10% </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Criteria SC1–SC4 correspond to a score automatically calculated, while criteria SC5 and SC6 will be manually scored by the experts of the Selection and Evaluation Committee (SEC). A final score will be calculated for each applicant, and a first ranking automatically produced, which will help the SEC do a first pre-selection.</p> 

          <p>Two knockout rounds of interviews will be performed. The first one focusing on transversal skills, and the second on technical background, including the discussion of a research paper.</p> 

          <p>A main and a reserve list will be produced (with a third interview for borderline candidates) and when approved by the relevant Home and Host universities, the Committee will notify the applicants of the result of the selection process. Non-granted candidates may appeal through a complaint letter.</p> 

          <p>Selected applicants will receive an official letter of acceptance, the Candidate Agreement and practical information about the programme. After confirmation from the candidate who will return the Candidate Agreement signed, the hiring and registration process will start at the corresponding beneficiaries.</p>

            <p>The winter schools are devoted to the development of transferable skills. The first one brings knowledge and skills from the ethical and legal domains, which are crucial for data scientists. The second winter school provides ESRs with knowledge about how to commercialize research results, first focusing on entrepreneurship and exploring how to turn research into innovations and new startups, and then focusing on Intellectual Property Rights and give an understanding of the importance of using patents. </p>

            <p>The summer schools are devoted to core scientific skills and explore emerging perspectives in Data Science. The first one provides ESRs with deep understanding of the relationship between data analytics and the management of Big Data. The second one reinforces students with knowledge and experience of applied statistics.</p>

            <p>The final conference disseminates the results of the project to both industry and academic sectors.</p>

            <p>Both academic and non-academic partners are involved in all schools and the final conference. In addition to offering training opportunities, the winter and summer schools also act as mechanisms for the ESRs to present and discuss their research and training, and get feedback from all members of the consortium (both academic and non-academic) as well as external experts, thus being collectively monitored and externally evaluated.</p>
